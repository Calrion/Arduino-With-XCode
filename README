README file for Arduino on XCode project by Tim Knapen.
Based on Robert Carlsen's and other people's efforts.

The original manual by Robert Carlsen is here:
http://robertcarlsen.net/2009/02/28/using-arduino-in-xcode-532

I started again on this after reading and following this great tutorial:
http://www.quietless.com/kitchen/setting-up-xcode-to-compile-upload-to-an-arduino-atmega328-duemilanove/

This has been tested with XCode3.2.6 and Arduino 0022 on OSX10.6.8
with Sanguino, Arduino NG (atmega8) and Arduino UNO

Installing the templates:
Copy the folder Arduino to your XCode project templates folder.
For me this is at:
/Developer/Library/XCode/Project Templates/

GOOD LUCK !!
