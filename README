README file for Arduino on XCode project by Tim Knapen.
Based on Robert Carlsen's and other people's efforts.

This has been tested with XCode3.2.6 and Arduino 0022 on OSX10.6.8
with Sanguino and Arduino NG (atmega8)

Installing the templates:
Copy the folder Arduino to your XCode project templates folder.
For me this is at:
/Developer/Library/XCode/Project Templates/

GOOD LUCK
